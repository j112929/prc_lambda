/**
 * task4-1
 * <p>
 * You are given an array of integers numbers. Your task is to count the number of distinct pairs (i, j) such that 0 â‰¤ i < j < numbers.length, numbers[i] and numbers[j] have the same number of digits, and only one of the digits differ between numbers[i] and numbers[j].
 * Example
 * For numbers = [1, 151, 241, 1, 9, 22, 351], the output should be solution(numbers) = 3.
 * numbers[0] = 1 differs from numbers[4] = 9 on the one and only digit in both numbers.
 * numbers[1] = 151 differs from numbers[6] = 351 on the first digit.
 * numbers[3] = 1 differs from numbers[4] = 9 on the one and only digit in both numbers.
 * Note that numbers[0] = 1 and numbers[3] = 1 do not differ from each other at all and thus do not count as a valid pair.
