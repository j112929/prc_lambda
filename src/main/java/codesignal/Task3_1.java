 * <p>
 * Given  a  matrix  of  integers,  we'd  like  to  consider  the  sum  of  the  elements  within  the  area  of  a  45Â°  rotated  rectangle.  More  formally,  the  area  is  bounded  by  two  diagonals  parallel  to  the  main  diagonal  and  two  diagonals  parallel  to  the  secondary  diagonal.  The  dimensions  of  the  rotated  rectangle  are  defined  by  the  number  of  elements  along  the  borders  of  the  rectangle.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Given  integers  a  and  b  representing  the  dimensions  of  the  rotated  rectangle,  and  matrix  (a  matrix  of  integers),
 * your  task  is  to  find  the  greatest  sum  of  integers  contained  within  an  a  x  b  rotated  rectangle.
 * Note:  The  order  of  the  dimensions  is  not  important  -  consider  all  a  x  b  and  b  x  a  rectangles.
